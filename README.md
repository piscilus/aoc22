## Implementation details

The code is written in C99 without any use of libraries except standard library.
Every day is a separate program. The puzzle input is stored two files:

- data_example.txt
- data_contest.txt (not under version control)

```console
$> ./program data_example.txt
```

I use msys, gcc, GNU make, Visual Studio Code for development and debugging.
